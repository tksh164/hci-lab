## ‚úíÔ∏è Notes

- The log files of the custom scripts are stored under `C:\temp\hcilab-logs` in the lab host Azure VM. Those log files are helpful for troubleshooting when deployment fails.

## üì¶ External artifacts

- The custom script `create-base-vhd.ps1` in this template downloads `Convert-WindowsImage.ps1` from [microsoft/MSLab](https://github.com/microsoft/MSLab) and uses it during the deployment.
